# Exam Tips & Tricks! 

## 1.) Disect the wireframe look at the create form to determine what your model is and what fields it should have as well as validations 

## 2.) Create the project folder. Inside that project folder create a server folder and run npx create-react-app name-of-app to create your client 

## 3.) I suggest starting in the server folder. Create server.js as well as your config, controllers, models and routes folders then start filling out all the server logic you can go in whatever order you want I like to fill out server.js and mongoose.config.js first then I move to the models then routes and controllers.

## 4.) I HIGHLY recommend that BEFORE you move to the client (react app) you test out ALL of your routes with postman. This should ensure that your server is or is not working correctly. Once all routes are tested and working as they should move to the client

## 5.) Break the wireframe down into small manageable pieces and start tackling one at a time I like to start with home/landing page then move to create, read one, update, and then delete but you can go in whatever order you would like 

# IMPORTANT REMINDER Delete the node modules folders in BOTH Server and Client
