I tried registering with an email already used. How do you do that?

login error message?????????
const [error, setError] = useState("")
.catch((err) => {
                console.log(err.response.data.message);//change to 
                setError(err.response.data.message);//chris
            })
{//chris
                    error?
                    <p>{error}</p>
                    ://if not explicit, it will become this instead
                    null
}


For posting a album,regardless of the missing information, it still displays "You must be logged in to post an album"
The edit page doesnt display placeholder in the form. How to fix that?
How to make the edit button only visible to the authenticated?
and how to make the delete button only visible to the authenticated?
What does UserContext do?
What is .env used for?

The posting albums is not linked to the user account.
